# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
You can ensure that your code is functional by using automated and manual testing techniques. You can ensure that your code is secure by using software that scans your code for software vulnerablities and by using coding best practices like encapsulation. 
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
You should be in close contact with the user to make sure that his needs are met. Also using documents to record their needs is important so that you can refer to it while you work on the code. 
# How do I approach designing software?
You approach designing software by getting a birds eye view of the requirments and then using programs like Lucidcharts to create a diagram of what an example architecture would look like. Then meet with teammates and discuss with them.
